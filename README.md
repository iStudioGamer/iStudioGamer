# 🎮 iStudioGamer

**AI-native performance infrastructure. Engineered through gaming. Powered by code.**  
**Designed by an engineer.**

---

### 🧠 Vision

iStudioGamer is a hybrid infrastructure project operating at the intersection of:

- High-performance 4K gaming (local + cloud-based)
- Source-built benchmarking, encoding, and telemetry tools
- Python-powered automation and runtime orchestration
- NVIDIA GPU stack (RTX 4090 / 4080) + GeForce NOW integration
- AI/LLM-enhanced pipelines and creative tooling
- Cross-platform workflows (Linux, macOS, cloud)

This GitHub organization documents the **living architecture** behind the studio — where systems thinking meets full-stack performance.
