# 🎮 iStudioPlay  
AI-native YouTube infrastructure — engineered to automate content operations using code-first workflows.

## 🧠 Vision  
**iStudioPlay** is the flagship infrastructure project of [`iStudioLabs`](https://github.com/iStudioLabs).  
It defines a reproducible system for managing YouTube gaming content as code, treating videos, metadata, and publishing workflows as version-controlled assets.  
The goal: automation, consistency, and full-stack control over the content lifecycle.
